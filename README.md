### What I learned

I decided to code this website in plain HTML & CSS, without using any frameworks. 
However I find that some Bootstrap conventions are  very helpful (for example the grid system) and I used some of them in my CSS.


```css
.col-md-6 {
  ...
}

.justify-content-center {
  justify-content: center;
}
```

For this project, as in the majority of the projects I worked on, I adopted a Mobile-first workflow.

Mobile first design approach allows you to think about what actually needs to be on your site. Instead of trying to fill in all the whitespace with fluff, you can give priority to what the user actually needs to complete the action.


I also focused on the indentation of my code.
I think that a good indentation is key, especially if you collaborate with other people.
The code is more readable and it's easier to find what you're looking for.
